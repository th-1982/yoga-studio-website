  #### Room for improvement on User Stories

While all the minimum criteria for fullfilling the user stories are met, there are several items that could be improved upon:

1. A map could be included at the bottom of the contact page to give more explicit directions to the location. This would strengthen user story number 9.

2. A  more explicit section like blogs, workshops or link could be provided on new services and news. This would stengthen user story number 7.

3. More information about the fascilities could be included, in the form of text about or images of the building, rooms, and images of free parking space provided for the users. This would strengthen user story number 5. 

## Bugs & fixes
* The hero image could not be uploaded to image folder because of the size of the image. I was able to fixed it by using smaller image and [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) to compress the image.
* When I deployed my project to Github pages. I had to wait for the link more than one hour. But I got assistance from Tutor support and it was fixed.

## Deployment & Development

The website was deployed using GitHub Pages by following these steps:

1. In the GitHub respository navigate to the Settings tab.
2. Select Pages from the menu on the left-hand side of the page.
3. For the source select Branch: 'main' and then select: 'save'.
4. After the webpage refreshes automatically a ribbon at the top will displays the following message: "Your site is live at https://th-1982.github.io/yoga-studio-website/"

The website repository can be forked by the following steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right hand corner.

The repository can be cloned by the following steps:

1. Got to the GitHub repository.
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click on it.
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone and paste the URL from the clipboard ($ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY)
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

  #### Room for improvement on User Stories

While all the minimum criteria for fullfilling the user stories are met, there are several items that could be improved upon:

1. A map could be included at the bottom of the contact page to give more explicit directions to the location. This would     strengthen user story number 9.

2. A  more explicit section like blogs, workshops or link could be provided on new services and news. This would stengthen user story number 7.

3. More information about the fascilities could be included, in the form of text about or images of the building, rooms, and images of free packing space provided for the users. This would strengthen user story number 5. 

## Bugs & fixes
* The hero image could not be uploaded to image folder because of the size of the image. I was able to fixed it by using smaller image and [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) to compress the image.
* When I deployed my project to Github pages. I had to wait for the link more one hour. But I got assistance from Tutor support and it was fixed.
* I could not see the wireframe in my README.md because i used wrong file path. It was discoverd and fixed.
